1. Answers to the reading questions. 
	1. What is tee used for? provide an example use case. 
		Answer: Tee is used to send a standard input to both a standard output (ie your monitor) and a file. 
		A possible example would be creating something like cat /var/logs/messages | grep dhclient | tee messages_logs.txt. This would allow you to see all system 			message logs associated to dhcp changes in the moment but also creat a file (messages_logs.txt) that stores the data for a later reference.  
	2. What does the command which tell you? 
		Answer: The which command tells you the exact location of an executable. This is useful if you have more than one version of an executable on your system. 
	3. How can you use the tilde ~ symbol in Linux? 
		Answer: We can use ~ at the beginning of a word to get the name of the home directory of the current or named user. This could be useful (potentially?) if 			you are looking for the home directory a different user. 
	4. What is one thing you learned about Vim in chapter 12? 
		Answer: I thought the ability to use add multiple files to the current editing session opens up a lot of doors (ie vi file1 file2 file 3). Specifically, 			using the :buffer <#> command to identify which file you want, then using yank, yy command, to copy text. Then using :bn to switchs files and p to paste 			data to the second document.  

2. What are the four Vi commands used to open a file for editing before a character, after a character, above a line or below a line.  
	Answer: Before a character = i 
		After a character = a 
		Above a line = O (uppercase “O”) 
		Below a line = o (lowercase “o”) 

3. Your vimtutor file name and absolute path. 
	Answer: Filename: vimtutor1.txt    
		Absolute path: /home/chrismcg/vimtutor1.txt 

4. The command used to find how many users have "/var/adm" defined as the home directory and answer.  
	Answer: cut -d: -f1,6 /etc/passwd | sort | uniq –f1   (kept column 1 to see user still and didn’t end up needing the sort as there was only 1 result.)

5. The command used to find the total number of invalid user errors and the answer. 
	Answer: Sudo cat /var/log/secure | grep ‘Invalid user’ | wc –l    (20088 as of this morning!) 

6. The command used to find all the failed usernames that have attempted to login to your prod system and answer (you can truncate this list if you want). 
	Answer: Sudo cat /var/log/secure | grep 'Invalid user' | cut -d' ' -f9 | uniq -c -u
 	(truncated results - just the first 40)
