5. Reading Questions
5a.What is a umask, and what is your umask setting for your dev and prod host?
	ANSWER: The umask command controls the default permission given to a file when it is created and is viewed in an octal format. This can be useful if we would like to alter any sort of file permissions for new file creations. If you want to make a file that has rw r r permissions, you would set umask to 0022 and files created after that would have those permissions.   

5b. What problem does SSH solve for linux and Unix users"? 
	ANSWER: The older programs used to remotely login, like ftp or telnet, transmitted all their communications in cleartext, which is a massive security risk. SSH solves that problem by authenticating the remote host is who they say they are and encrypts all communication between the local and remote host.  

5c. What command and options can you use to permission a file such that only the owner can READ the file. This means no one else on the system will have any access to the file without sudo or root access. 
	ANSWER1: After the file is created: chmod 400 <file.txt> 
	ANSWER2: Before the file is created: umask 0400   
		 > file.txt
