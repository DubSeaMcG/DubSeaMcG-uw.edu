READING QUESTIONS
1. How can you be sure to copy ACLs with your files?
	ANSWER: Run it from root - Sudo into the setfacl and set the default ACL for the folder. I could be wrong here, but that is what makes the most sense and nothing else is really jumping out.
2. What does the command firewall-cmd --query-panic do or answer for the administrator?
	ANSWER: firewall-cmd --panic-on disables all network traffic in case of an attack. firewall-cmd --panic-off turns reverts the firewall to it's permanent settings. the firewall-cmd --query-panic lets the user know if the firewall is set to "panic" or not. It shuts the system down. 
3. What utility does systemctl replace in regards to managing services in Linux?
	ANSWER: systemctl replaces service and chkconfig in Linux.

3. Output from getfacl showing your permissions for one of the nginx logs.
	ANSWER:
	[chrismcg@ulc-161 ~]$ sudo getfacl /var/log/nginx/error-8080.log
	getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
	# file: var/log/nginx/error-8080.log
	# owner: root
	# group: root
	user::rw-
	user:chrismcg:r--
	group::r--
	mask::r--
	other::r--

4. Does sestatus show a configured status and a current status for SELinux and if so how?
	ANSWER: It does show a configured status. I would guess that it due to the fact that is built into the kernel and is a process that doesn't require the full file location to run (as a program).

5. A git log showing the addition of the store and recall scripts.
